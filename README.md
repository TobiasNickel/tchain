project fo runderstanding blockchain technology by looging at actual code that works and is easy to understand.

# hashing functions
look at tchain.js (~ line 20)

# mining
tchain.js (~ line 40)

# distributed mining
distributed mining makes currently the most part. the blockHashServer.
it is made with koa JS and manages data and the blockchain. 

there is a webclient and a cli-Client that will get the current task to mine and try to find a solution.

the webClient can enter data to be stored. (unstructured text)

# validating
validating a block: tchain.js (~ line 100)
validateChain.js to validate the current blockchain of the server.

# future features:
distributed collecting of data (distributed servers or peer servers) I am not sure how.
authenticating users
